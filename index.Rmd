# Introduction

This document is a guide to using the Infographiq method for displaying data in a user-friendly way. The Infographiq method uses a combination of Javascript and R to produce clickable art that acts as an interface for users to access scientific data. An illustration of the Infographiq method can be seen below.

This guide details how to prepare:

1.  an Infographiq-ready image,
2.  the "modal windows" in which data is shown,
3.  the link table that connects the image with the modal windows,
4.  a web page to embed an Infographiq-enabled image.

You can find a demonstration of Infographiq, showing many of the options available with the associated Javascript library, [here](https://marinebon.org/infographiqJS/demo.html).

Infographiq can also display data in modal window form via a user-clickable table. In [this demonstration table](https://marinebon.org/infographiqJS/table_modalv1.html), click on any row to see the associated modal window.
