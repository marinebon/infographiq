# Introduction

This document is a guide to using the Infographiq method for displaying data in a user-friendly way.

## Infographiq: art + data

The Infographiq method uses a combination of Javascript and R to produce clickable art that acts as an interface for users to access scientific data. An illustration of the Infographiq method can be seen below.

This guide details how to prepare:

1.  [an Infographiq-ready image](https://marinebon.org/infographiq/image-creation.html),
2.  [the "modal windows" in which data is shown](https://marinebon.org/infographiq/modal-windows.html),
3.  [the link table that connects the image with the modal windows](https://marinebon.org/infographiq/link-table.html),
4.  [the relevant Javascript functions](https://marinebon.org/infographiq/infographic-javascript.html),
5.  [a web page to embed an Infographiq-enabled image](https://marinebon.org/infographiq/html-layout-with-bootstrap.html).

You can find a demonstration of Infographiq, showing many of the options available with the associated Javascript library, [here](https://marinebon.org/infographiqJS/demo.html).

## Infographiq: responsive tables

Infographiq can also display data via a user-clickable table. In [this demonstration table](https://marinebon.org/infographiqJS/table_modalv1.html), click on any row to see the associated figure. More information on these responsive tables can be found [elsewhere in this guide](https://marinebon.org/infographiq/responsive-data-tables.html).
