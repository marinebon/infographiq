# Modal windows

With the Infographiq method, when a clickable element of an image is clicked, a "modal window" containing data appears on the screen (see image below). To see examples of modal windows in action, check out the [Infographiq demonstration page](https://marinebon.org/infographiqJS/demo.html) and click on any element of the image that highlights.

In this section of the guide, we discuss how to create these modal windows. To get started, if you haven't do so already, [download the example folder](https://marinebon.org/infographiqJS/infographiq_example.zip) and unzip it. In the example folder, you'll find a subfolder called "modals" that contains several HTML files (see image below).

These HTML files comprise a range of types of modal windows.
